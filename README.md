# AlphaPIG
AlphaPIG is a meta-technique designed to Prolong Interactive Gestures by leveraging real-time fatigue predictions. AlphaPIG assists designers in extending and improving XR interactions by enabling automated fatigue-based interventions. Through adjustment of intervention timing and intensity decay rate, designers can explore and control the trade-off between fatigue reduction and potential effects such as decreased body ownership. 

## Input Parameters:
1. fatigueThreshold: Fatigue threshold to activate external ergonomic interaction techniques.
2. decayRateAlpha: The decay rate of Alpha.
3. manipulationMax: The maximum intervention effect of the chosen interaction variable.
4. manipulationMin: The default value of the chosen interaction variable.

## Output:
1. AlphaPIGManipulationVariable: The AlphaPIG-modified interaction variable.

## Notes:
